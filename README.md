# PyLarms
PyLarms is a timing module which includes a timer and an alarm.
PyLarms' timer sets a timer for a given amount of time in seconds
and returns True after it is done.
You can also give arguments such as "5 mins", "5 minutes" and
you can also do the same with hours like "1 hour", "1 hr", "2 hrs"
etc. Note that you cannot set days as arguments such as "5 days".
There is also an alarm which you can set to anytime you want.
The alarm uses 24-hour time instead of 12-hour time.
